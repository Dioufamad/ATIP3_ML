- HKGs_common_search.py :
take 3 lists of sorted best HGs (one for each cohorts) and gives the list of commons HKGs
- HKGs_common_search_for_Aexp_comp.py :
take 3 lists of sorted best HGs (one for each cohorts) and gives the list of commons HKGs
this is the version where probes with numbers that are removed do not have a report on them
(unify with HKGs_common_search.py)
- HKGs_common_search_on_GEO_datasets1.py :
take 3 lists of sorted best HGs (one for each cohorts) and gives the list of commons HKGs
this is the version where you can sort the full table on the order of HKGs of a cohort (on the side you have a version with alphbetical order and overall rank)
- HKGs_search.py :
for a cohort given locally, create the list of HKGs (alphabetical and sorted on CV versions)
- HKGs_search_on_GEO_datasets1.py :
for a GSE dataset, create the list of HKGs (alphabetical, sorted on CV, the top20ofCV, the top20Alphabetical versions)
- HKPs_1.R :
(not useful finally) a trial of coding the HKG search in R
