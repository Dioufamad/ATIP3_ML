Name of script used : C1_gridsearchcv_sklearn_corr1
Goal : the API is sklearn, 10 seeds, gridsearchcv, cv = 10, reg = L1, datasets : 7 cohorts on by one
NB : for cohort 6 (ie with 4 samples, cv=4)
Values of the regulariation strength tested
# A_space1_2plus1value_sorted # 0.0001 to 100 (200 lambda values, including default value 1)
# A_space1_2plus1value_sorted_inverts # 10000 to 0.01 (200 C values including the default value)
# use A_space1_2plus1value_sorted_inverts for all C values exploratory search
# use A_space1_2plus1value_sorted for all lambda values exploratory search
#=========================================================================
# - the test done is : about seeing what is making our value instable eventhough we fixated a seed at each loop step (ie omewhere is missing a seed setting step)
#>>>>>>>>>>>> observe the phenomenan : run 1 uses the mcc

#>>>>>>>>>>>> the test score are the same between the same seed over 2 different runs but the lambda values tend to jump so something is happening inside the gridsearch.
and we know that the gridsearch does not have a random state option, so it is the alg inside it.
lets do the next test with the random state inside the lag used in the gridsearch set. we set it as the seed of this whole loop step
