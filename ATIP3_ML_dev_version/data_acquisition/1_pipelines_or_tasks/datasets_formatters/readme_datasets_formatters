>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>geo_datasets_importer : for the datasets from GEO imported using the GSE
- demo1_GEO_datasets.R :
the base model of the script used to extract GSE datasets from GEO and analyse until found statistics
- GEO_dataset_w_best_probesets_only_maker.R :
extract a GSE dataset, keep only the best probe for a gene and produce the dataset
- GEO_datasets_only_atip3_probes_rows.R :
(to continue) a trial to get the GSE dataset woth only the MTUS1 probes
- GEO_datasets_R02_R04_MDA.R :
extract a GSE dataset, keep only the best probe for a gene and produce the dataset
make the histogram for the sample 1, sample 2, and sample 3
get the statistics of the columns

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>homemade_R02_R04_MDA_formatter : for the 3 cohorts used initially but from data given locally
- R02_formater_4_ATIP3_ML.py :
use the clinical info file (as left file), the gene expression table (as the right file), and join them
change the columns name if necessary
make the values as log2 if wanted
- R02xR04xMDA_annot_formater.py :
using the base file with annotations, make a simpler 2 cols file for each dataset : a col of probe and a col of the full report on the GS, GBAN and probe name
