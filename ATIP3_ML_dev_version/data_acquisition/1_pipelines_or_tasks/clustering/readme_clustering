- HC_correction_on_R02_R04_MDA.py :
input : a cohort, a number of clusters wanted, a table of previous work clusters where each sample belong
output : the heatmap of the clusters chosen, a report on the intersection numbers with a previous work
- HC_correction_trial1_on_R02.py : just the copy of base model script sent by Chloé to redo the clustering and that we started playing with first
differences : the intersection computation at the end have been changed to be more informative
- HC_heatmap.R :
this was the first script used in R to make the first heatmaps that were rejected.
Advantages : contains how torestrict the dataset to probes of MTUS1 and good if..else condittions codes
- HierarchicalClustering_by_Chloe_for_HC_correction scripts (.py, .ipynb and .html) :
these are the 3 versions of the base model script sent by Chloé to redo the clustering
- Hm_dg1.R :
this is the base model script that inspired HC_heatmap.R
- JMP7.pptx :
this is a capture of the documentation of the parameters of JMP7
- MDA_corresponding_names_table_maker1.R :
for MDA, make a file with only the correspondance between the two different nominations of samples (the old classes of samples in Sylvie's work is present also)
- MDA_samples_corresponder.R :
for MDA, make a file with only the correspondance between the two different nominations of samples (the old classes of samples in Sylvie's work is present also)
then the correspondance between old classes and new classes is made
- R02_corresponding_names_table_maker1.R :
for R02, make a file with only the correspondance between the two different nominations of samples (the old classes of samples in Sylvie's work is present also)
- R02_samples_corresponder.R :
for R02, make a file with only the correspondance between the two different nominations of samples (the old classes of samples in Sylvie's work is present also)
then the correspondance between old classes and new classes is made
- R02_gene_probes_hm.py :
restrict a cohort to the probes of MTUS1 and make heatmaps with those probes only
